                        <p><strong>Life can get complicated really quickly</strong>, but it doesn't have to be!
                            There are many ways to simplify your life, <u>a few of which we've explored in the
                                past</u>. This week we're taking a bit of a approach though, in how you can find
                            simplicity in the life you already living.
                        </p>

                        <p>Food is a very important part of everyone's life. If you want to be healthy, you have to
                            eat healthy. One of the easiest ways to do that is to keep your cooking nice and simple.

                        <p>Work is often a major source of stress. People get frustrated, it ruins their
                            relationship with others and it leads to burnout. By keeping your work life as simple as
                            possible, it will help balance everything out. </p>

                        <p>A home isn't a home until you've decorated a little. People either don't decorate, or
                            they go overboard and it doesn't have the impact they were hoping for. Staying simple
                            will help draw the eye where you want it to and make things pop like never before. </p>
